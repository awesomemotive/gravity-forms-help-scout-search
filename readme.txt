== Installation ==

1. The Help Scout Docs Search Field plugin requires the Help Scout Docs sub-domain to be set. Define it using the `HELPSCOUT_DOCS_SUBDOMAIN` constant, or set it using the `gf_helpscout_docs_subdomain` filter. You can find it in Help Scout under "Manage" > "Docs" > "Site Settings" > "Sub-domain".
`
define( 'HELPSCOUT_DOCS_SUBDOMAIN', 'Your sub-domain here' );
`

2. Add a text field to your Gravity Forms form, then add `helpscout-docs` to the "Custom CSS Class" setting (in the field's Appearance tab).

3. Optionally, use the GF_HELPSCOUT_DOCS_COLLECTIONS constant to specify the collection IDs the plugin should search in. Example:
`
define( 'GF_HELPSCOUT_DOCS_COLLECTIONS', '538f1914e4b034fd486247ce:548f192ae4b07d03cb25288e:5488f10de4bs2c8d3cacdf29' );
`
